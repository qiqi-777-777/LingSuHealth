# Frontend Design

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic aesthetics and deliver a deliberate visual direction.

## When to Use

- Building a new component, page, or interface
- Redesigning UI for stronger visual character
- Implementing UI with high aesthetic polish
- Reviewing and improving visual consistency

## Design Thinking

Before coding, establish:

- **Purpose**: What problem the interface solves and who uses it
- **Tone**: Choose a clear aesthetic direction (e.g., brutalist, editorial, retro-futuristic, luxury)
- **Constraints**: Framework, performance, accessibility requirements
- **Differentiation**: The one memorable element that stands out

## Implementation Priorities

- Use production-ready code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.)
- Keep the visual system cohesive and intentional
- Match implementation complexity to the chosen aesthetic

## Aesthetics Guidelines

**Typography**
- Use characterful fonts
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font

**Color & Theme**
- Commit to a cohesive palette
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Prefer bold accents over timid palettes

**Motion**
- Use motion for high-impact moments
- Prefer CSS animations when possible
- Add staggered reveals for delight

**Spatial Composition**
- Consider asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, or grid-breaking elements
- Use deliberate negative space or controlled density

**Backgrounds & Visual Details**
- Add depth with gradients, textures, or layered transparencies
- Use decorative borders, dramatic shadows, or grain overlays when appropriate

## Avoid

- Generic fonts (Arial, Inter, Roboto)
- Cliché color schemes or predictable layouts
- Cookie-cutter component patterns without context

## Output

Deliver working code with a clear, memorable aesthetic point-of-view.
