# Web Interface Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Web Interface Guidelines.

## How It Works

- Fetch the latest guidelines from the source URL below
- Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
- Check against all rules in the fetched guidelines
- Output findings in the terse file:line format

## Guidelines Source

Fetch fresh guidelines before each review:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines/main/command.md

Use WebFetch to retrieve the latest rules. The fetched content contains all the rules and output format instructions.

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:

- Fetch guidelines from the source URL above
- Read the specified files
- Apply all rules from the fetched guidelines
- Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.
